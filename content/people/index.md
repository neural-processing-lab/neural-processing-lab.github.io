### Oiwi Parker Jones
> Principal Investigator

{{< figure src="oiwi.png" alt="Pratik" width="250px">}}

Oiwi leads the Parker Jones Neural Processing Lab (PNPL) at the University of Oxford. His aim is to build bridges between deep learning and the brain, for example by accelerating the development of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs), but also by developing deep learning methods for interpreting brain data and leveraging principles of systems neuroscience to inform machine learning. Oiwi completed a DPhil focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages. He further trained as a postdoc in Imaging Neuroscience at UCL and Oxford, and in Applied Artificial Intelligence at the ORI. He was previously a lecturer in Medicine at St Peter's College, Oxford, and is currently Hugh Price Fellow in Computer Science at Jesus College, Oxford.

### Pratik Somaiya
> Software Engineer

{{< figure src="pratik.jpg" alt="Pratik" width="250px" >}}

Pratik joined the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI) in May 2023 as a Robotics Software Engineer. Before that, he pursued an MSc by Research in Robotics at the Lincoln Centre for Autonomous Systems Research (L-CAS), University of Lincoln, UK. Prior to his Master's, he was a Research Assistant at L-CAS working in agri-robotics. Pratik also spent several years in the industry before joining L-CAS. During that time, he worked on developing robots for warehouse material handling and consumer robots such as vacuum cleaning robots.

### Dulhan Jayalath
> PhD Student

{{< figure src="dulhan.png" alt="Dulhan" width="250px" >}}

Dulhan is a DPhil student in the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems (AIMS) CDT. At PNPL, his work focuses on leveraging deep learning to find efficient representations of brain signals for downstream tasks (e.g. phoneme recognition from heard speech brain data). Prior to joining PNPL, he worked on multi-agent RL and reasoning with graph neural networks at the University of Cambridge. Before this, he completed his BSc in Computer Science at the University of Southampton, where he researched computer vision systems for visual navigation. He has worked on large language models at Speechmatics and developing assembly-level machine learning kernels for new hardware at Arm.

### Gilad D. Landau
> PhD Student

{{< figure src="gilad.png" alt="Gilad" width="250px" >}}

Gilad is a D.Phil student currently working on decoding semantic content from the brain with AI. He is motivated by the prospect of merging brains with AI to deepen our understanding of both. His academic background is in Philosophy of Cognitive Science, where he applied a multi-disciplinary approach to explore how brains process representations. Prior to joining PNPL he worked as an applied AI researcher, developing industry-first AI systems in several domains and modalities.

### Birtan Demirel
> Research Assistant

{{< figure src="birtan.webp" alt="Birtan" width="250px" >}}

Birtan completed his MSc degree in Psychology, Neuroscience and Human Sciences at the University of Pavia, Italy. He also trained at the Neurology Department, University Medical Center Goettingen, Germany, where he used real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for his Master's research project. He is carrying out research for his DPhil at the University of Oxford with Prof. Kate Watkins in the Department of Experimental Psychology, and Prof. Charlotte Stagg at the Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging and MRC BNDU, funded by a grant from the Dominic Barker Trust. Birtan also teaches neurophysiology at undergraduate level as part of a Graduate Development Scholarship from St. Anne's College, Oxford. Birtan is interested in speech-motor impairments and how acute stress physiology, cognitive functions and emotions affect speech production. He uses transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) alongside advanced neuroimaging techniques of MRI, functional MRI, and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The results of his studies should inform further neuroimaging studies in stuttering and provide possible therapeutic interventions for people who want to work on their speech fluency.

### Brian Liu
> Visiting Student

{{< figure src="brian.jpg" alt="Brian" width="250px" >}}

Brian is a junior at Bowdoin College studying abroad in Oxford, majoring in mathematics and computer science and minoring in music. He is interested in intersecting mathematical deductions of music, human processes and decisions, and the natural world with programming, as well as leveraging technology to benefit the common good and uncover truths in capital systems.

### Charlotte Gerhaher
> Master's Student

{{< figure src="charlotte.png" alt="Charlotte" width="250px" >}}

Charlotte is an MSc student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford, with a background in bioinformatics and veterinary medicine. She joined PNPL for her master's thesis to work on brain data synthesis using deep generative models, addressing the scarcity of data augmentation options for brain data. Before embarking on her current studies, she completed a BSc in Bioinformatics at the Technical University of Munich and Ludwig Maximilian University, where she focused on reducing bias in state-of-the-art machine learning models for the classification of thoracic diseases in chest X-rays.

### Jeremy Ridge
> Master's Student

{{< figure src="jeremy.jpeg" alt="Jeremy" width="250px" >}}

Jeremy is a current MSc student in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Oxford, associated with Wolfson College. He is completing his master's dissertation with the PNPL group focusing on deep learning applications for non-invasive neuroimaging data. Before coming to Oxford, he completed his bachelors at the University of Pennsylvania, double majoring in Cognitive Science and Computer Science.

### Pablo Soëtard

{{< figure src="pablo.png" alt="Pablo" width="250px" >}}

Pablo is an MSc student in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science at the University of Oxford. At PNPL, his work focuses on studying the mathematical structures that encode speech on the brain, through the use of Selective State Space Models. Prior to joining PNPL, he worked on RL for quantum communication protocols at the National Research Council of Spain, and in the Neurocomputing group at UAM on neural pattern generators for robotics control. During his undergraduate years he studied a BEng in Computer Science and Engineering and another BEng in Telecommunications Engineering at UAM. He has worked on information retrieval systems, computer vision and MLOps for the past 4 summers at Google as a Research Software Engineer.
